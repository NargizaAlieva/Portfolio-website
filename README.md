# Portfolio-website

I made my portfolio-website that contains 6 html pages. I designed every page to make my website look beautiful. To all pages I set max and min width to not crack the pages by reducing screen width.

I make header and footer by using display and flexbox.

First page is 'home' that welcomes user to my portfolio webpage it contains short greeting and navigation menu. On this page on banner section I plased picture that will change depends of screen size.

Second page is 'about' at this page I give some information about me. There I use Flexbox to place some objects. Also I made banner saction with 'index' to plase picture at bckground. Also used filter:blur and opasity.

Third page is 'resume' at this page I create my resume by flexbox, border, background-color and so on.

Fourth page is 'works' there I plased pictures and shopt desctiption of my earlier projects not only front-end projects. Also I provide links to githup page to some progects.

Fifth page is 'gallery' sorry I dont have lots of pictures of me so I placed there pictures of country and some artworks from internet. There I also used flexbox.

Sixth page is 'contucts' there I added links for each contact so user can just click to the for example my e-mail address and will be sendet to email, so it makes it easier to contucts with me. Also there I places map and by click on it user can see on the map where I am.

PS: To make easier to undestend where is the links and where is just text, I edded hover effect that changes color of the link and make it transition smoother I edded transform: 1s. 

Thats all. Thank you for attection to this project.
